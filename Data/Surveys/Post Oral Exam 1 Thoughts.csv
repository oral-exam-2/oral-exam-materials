That is, consider the mechanics of the exam here (Moodle scheduler, use of Zoom, use of the Moodle rubric).","Please provide any detail to the above question about oral exam administration here.","Do you think the grading of the exams was fair to the students? If not, why and how could it be improved?","Logistically, do you have any concerns about giving the second oral exam?","On a scale of 1 (very little utility) to 10 (very high utility), how well did the exam act as an assessment of the material in the course?","Please provide any detail to the above question about the utility of the oral exam.","On a scale of 1 (very poor) to 10 (very useful), how would you rate the use of the oral exam generally?","Do you have any other thoughts about oral exams? Please share them here!"

Questions are too broad compared to the expected answer.","Time concerns mostly. 15 hours on Zoom will drive me insane.","2","Not sure what this accomplishes over a HW or Moodle quiz.","2","It made me very sad."

I hope we have a surprise code on it though, one they haven't seen before.","9","I think it works well - it does get a bit noisy/confounded with students who are very nervous or not confident in their English-speaking abilities.

I think of myself as technologically literate but the oral exams have challenged that conception","I think grading was mostly fair, though I perhaps was also more lenient","Zoom failing to do waiting rooms mostly","7","I think it made clear who had a good idea of what they've gotten well","6","Mostly just reinforced ideas that I was already getting from both the homeworks and seeing students in class in regard to their uptake of material"

Some behaviors of different levels have to be divided into the same level for the rubric. Maybe we can add more levels?","NA","9","","9",""
